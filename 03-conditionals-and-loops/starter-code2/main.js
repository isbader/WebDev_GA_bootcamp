## Independent Practice (10 min)
When programming user interfaces, you will often need to display results based on a certain input. In this exercise, help the students design a program that will let users know what legal privileges U.S. citizens enjoy based on their age.
Write a program that outputs results based on usersâ€™ age. This exercise draws on if/else statements, Boolean logic, and comparison operators. See the conditions below:
- If you are under 16, you cannot do much outside of going to school
- If you are 16 or older, you can drive
- If you 18 or older, you can vote
- If you are 21 or older, you can smoke cigarettes
- If you are 25 or older, you can rent a car
- If you are 35 or older, you can run for president
- If you are 62 or older, you collect social security benefits
Have the program print out only the most recent thing that they've become eligible to do, i.e. if they are 46, only print "You can run for president." (This will at least force them to use `else if` instead of just `if`).
Students can work in pairs to complete the exercise.

/* EXTRA WORK
**2: Random Address Generator**
- Write a script that can generate random addresses
- As a first step, create arrays that contain dummy data for each of the following: street number, street name, city name, state name and zip code
- Your script should randomly select one item from each of these arrays and then use them to construct a random address
- Each time you run the script, it should print a new randomly-generated address to the terminal. For example:
- `node random-address.js`
- `=> 34578 Dolphin Street, Wonka NY, 44506`
